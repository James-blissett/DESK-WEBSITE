# Image Placement Instructions

## Studio Ghibli Desk Image

Please save the Studio Ghibli style desk image (the one showing the warm wooden desk with robotic arms in a cozy room) to:

```
/home/user/DESK-WEBSITE/public/desk-studio-ghibli.jpg
```

The code is already configured to display this image with:
- Rounded corners (rounded-3xl)
- Fade effect into the background
- Proper sizing and responsive layout

Once the image is placed in the public folder, it will automatically appear on the homepage below the main hero text "Be more comfortable and productive, without paying an arm and a leg."
