# Public Assets Directory

## Required Image

To complete the Studio Ghibli design, please add your Ghibli desk image to this directory:

**File name:** `ghibli-desk.jpg`
**Location:** `/public/ghibli-desk.jpg`

The image will be used as the background for the hero section on the homepage.

### Alternative Options

If you don't have a Ghibli desk image yet, you can:
1. Add any desk image and rename it to `ghibli-desk.jpg`
2. Use an online image by updating the CSS in `app/globals.css` (line 26) to use a URL instead
3. The site will still work with the gradient background if no image is present

### Image Specifications

- **Recommended size:** 1920x1080px or larger
- **Format:** JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Aspect ratio:** 16:9 (wide landscape)
- **Content:** Should feature a desk or workspace with a Ghibli-inspired aesthetic
